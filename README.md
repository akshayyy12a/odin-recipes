# odin-recipes
This is a project where i'll create a Webpage for the tiramisu's recipe.

I will use for now only  HTML. But when my CSS skills will be improved i'll comeback on this to complete it.

This is my first project ever on HTML.

At the end of this project i should have demonstrated HTML/CSS skills.
